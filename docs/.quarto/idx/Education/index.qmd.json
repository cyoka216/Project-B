At the surface, these degrees may not seem related but each level has built on something learned or gained from the other training.  I started my academic journey at Cleveland State University pursuing dual majors in Religious Studies and Cultural Anthropology.  Through this course of study, I had aspirations that I would end up as a cultural writer for National Geographic or that I would work at the Smithsonian (perhaps I should note that I was a major fan of Indiana Jones as a child).  Either way, my goal was to work with people and learn about cultures outside of my own.  To cover a general education requirement, I took a course titled “Biology of Plants and Civilizations”.  The simple course description is as follows: “The nature and uses of plants; the effects of plants on civilization and vice versa.” As simple as the course description may be, the course offered a new and complex world to me that dove into the interactions between people and the environment.  In addition to my love for learning about people and culture, this course built on my love for being in the elements, and changed my trajectory as a student.  At that point, I decided to add another degree program, a Bachelor’s of Environmental Science, to my academic journey.  I maintained the coursework for the B.A. in Religious Studies, but decided not to pursue Cultural Anthropology. I grdauted in 2010 with a B.A. in Religious Studies and a B.S. in Environmental Sciences. \n\n----\n\n## A Middle Ground\n\n<img src=\"Swallowtail.jpg\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain\" onclick=\"window.open('https://preservationparks.com/ohios-magnificent-swallowtail-butterflies/', 'blank');\"/><a href=\"https://preservationparks.com/ohios-magnificent-swallowtail-butterflies/\" target=\"_blank\">Swallowtail on Coneflower</a> \n\nIn 2011, I enrolled in the Master of Arts in Zoology program offered by Miami University (OH).  Miami University’s Advanced Inquiry Program (AIP) collaborates with zoos across the country to host student cohorts and focuses on using inquiry within project based learning experiences.  Of the most memorable experiences was a multi-semester course that included travel to Guyana, South America.  During the course “Local Wisdom and Conservation,” my class was hosted by an indigenous community, the Makushi, who were experiencing a shift away from their cultural values.  The community elders were trying to maintain traditional beliefs while experiencing outside influences.  The key take-away that I had from the course was to trust the community.  They know what is going on in their homes, understand what they are experiencing, and know the solutions. \n\nMy capstone project was an attempt to bridge the gap my between my interest in culture and environment by developing an understanding of how individuals establish their environmental views. I conducted a series of interviews of environmental professionals to try to identify that \"key\" moment that led them to their career choice. I also analyzed community comment on sustainability initiatives at Cleveland's local sustainability conference. The following year, my analysis was featured as the center pages of the conference's program book. I did not really know it at the time, but these were some of my first experiences in conducting qualitative interviews. Should I redo that project today, I would likely take a different approach.  However, this work provided me with the foundation skills to complete the work that I do now. \n\n----\n\n## Today \n\n<img src=\"aster.jpg\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain\" onclick=\"window.open('https://fieldbioinohio.blogspot.com/2011/11/some-ohio-asters.html', 'blank');\"/>\n<a href=\"https://fieldbioinohio.blogspot.com/2011/11/some-ohio-asters.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ohio Aster</a> \n\nIn 2018, I joined the Cleveland Department of Public Health as the Chief of Air Pollution Outreach. My background in both Environmental Sciences and the Humanities combined with my work experience provided me the right set of skills to communicate complicated environmental topics with the community. In 2020, I was thrown into a new dynamic of Public Health through the COVID-19 pandemic as a member of the COVID-19 response team. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was leading training sessions on contact tracing for volunteers and staff at CDPH.  I was fascinated by the process of disease investigation and learning about the natural history of the coronavirus.  That was my “Biology of Plants and Civilizations” moment for this stage in my life - the trajectory changer. My experiences working as a member of the COVID-19 response team exposed me to a different aspect of public health than what I had come to know by introducing me to the science behind disease transmission.  \n\nAlthough I had been exposed to epidemiology before, this was a whole new level and I was fascinated by it. I started to learn about epidemiological curves, transmission rates, and so much more.  Prior to that experience, I was not really interested in communicable diseases or the more traditional forms of public health. As luck would have it, Case Western Reserve University secured a funding opportunity to support public health professionals in obtaining a Master in Public Health degree. The Public Health Training for Northeast Ohio Workforce (PHT-NOW) program has given me an opportunity to pursue an MPH on a full scholarship.  My concentration is in Global Health and I am actively working to build my skill set in epidemiology and statistical analysis. Epidemiology and statistcs are the foundation in understanding global health and can be equally applied to environmental sciences topics. I am really drawn to vector borne diseases and how changes to the environment influence disease transmission. \n\nCheck out this paper I wrote \"Ixodes scapularis: A Trailblazer for Vector Borne Pathogens in Eastern United States and southeast Canada\" that explores the relationship between the geographic expansion of the hard bodied tick and environmental conditions. This paper is a good demonstration of how I view the connections between my background in environmental sciences and public health. This is a research area that I hope to continue to build on throughout my time at Case Western Reserve University and in future career choices. \n\nWhat happens after I graduate from CWRU in December 2025? It's hard to say. I intend on continuing to build on my skills in data analysis, specifically around environmental health exposures.  I am considering pursuing a Doctorate's Degree in Public Health, but time and opportunity will tell. \n\n```{=html}\n<p class=\"text-center\">\n  <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-lg cv-download\" href=\"`r rmarkdown::metadata$projects$pdf`\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <i class=\"fa-solid fa-file-arrow-down\"></i>&ensp;Download Trailblazer\n  </a>\n  \n```\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## The Early Days\n\n<img src=\"spiderwort.jpg\" style=\"height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain\" onclick=\"window.open('https://grownative.org/native_plants/ohio-spiderwort/', 'blank');\"/><a href=\"https://grownative.org/native_plants/ohio-spiderwort/\" target=\"_blank\">Spiderwort and Coreopsis</a>\n\nHow does one find themselves with a B.A. Comparative Religious Studies, a B.S. in Environmental Sciences, an M.A. in Conservation Studies/Biology, and pursuing a Masters in Public Health?
