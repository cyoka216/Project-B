I started my academic journey at Cleveland State University pursuing dual majors in Religious Studies and Cultural Anthropology.

Either way, my goal was to work with people and learn about cultures outside of my own. To cover a general education requirement, I took a course titled “Biology of Plants and Civilizations”. The simple course description is as follows: “The nature and uses of plants; the effects of plants on civilization and vice versa.” As simple as the course description may be, the course offered a new and complex world to me that dove into the interactions between people and the environment. In addition to my love for learning about people and culture, this course built on my love for being in the elements, and changed my trajectory as a student. At that point, I decided to add another degree program, a Bachelor’s of Environmental Science, to my academic journey.

Miami University’s Advanced Inquiry Program (AIP) collaborates with zoos across the country to host student cohorts and focuses on using inquiry within project based learning experiences. Of the most memorable experiences was a multi-semester course that included travel to Guyana, South America. During the course “Local Wisdom and Conservation,” my class was hosted by an indigenous community, the Makushi, who were experiencing a shift away from their cultural values. The community elders were trying to maintain traditional beliefs while experiencing outside influences. The key take-away that I had from the course was to trust the community. They know what is going on in their homes, understand what they are experiencing, and know the solutions.\nMy capstone project was an attempt to bridge the gap my between my interest in culture and environment by developing an understanding of how individuals establish their environmental views. I conducted a series of interviews of environmental professionals to try to identify that “key” moment that led them to their career choice. I also analyzed community comment on sustainability initiatives at Cleveland’s local sustainability conference. The following year, my analysis was featured as the center pages of the conference’s program book. I did not really know it at the time, but these were some of my first experiences in conducting qualitative interviews. Should I redo that project today, I would likely take a different approach. However, this work provided me with the foundational skills to complete the work that I do now."

In 2018, I joined the Cleveland Department of Public Health as the Chief of Air Pollution Outreach. My background in both Environmental Sciences and the Humanities combined with my work experience provided me the right set of skills to communicate complicated environmental topics with the community. In 2020, I was thrown into a new dynamic of Public Health through the COVID-19 pandemic as a member of the COVID-19 response team. During the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was leading training sessions on contact tracing for volunteers and staff at CDPH. I was fascinated by the process of disease investigation and learning about the natural history of the coronavirus. That was my “Biology of Plants and Civilizations” moment for this stage in my life - the trajectory changer. My experiences working as a member of the COVID-19 response team exposed me to a different aspect of public health than what I had come to know by introducing me to the science behind disease transmission.\nAlthough I had been exposed to epidemiology before, this was a whole new level and I was fascinated by it. I started to learn about epidemiological curves, transmission rates, and so much more. Prior to that experience, I was not really interested in communicable diseases or the more traditional forms of public health. As luck would have it, Case Western Reserve University secured a funding opportunity to support public health professionals in obtaining a Master in Public Health degree. The Public Health Training for Northeast Ohio Workforce (PHT-NOW) program has given me an opportunity to pursue an MPH on a full scholarship. My concentration is in Global Health and I am actively working to build my skill set in epidemiology and statistical analysis. Epidemiology and statistcs are the foundation in understanding global health and can be equally applied to environmental sciences topics. I am really drawn to vector borne diseases and how changes to the environment influence disease transmission.\nCheck out this paper I wrote “Ixodes scapularis: A Trailblazer for Vector Borne Pathogens in Eastern United States and southeast Canada” that explores the relationship between the geographic expansion of the hard bodied tick and environmental conditions. This paper is a good demonstration of how I view the connections between my background in environmental sciences and public health. This is a research area that I hope to continue to build on throughout my time at Case Western Reserve University and in future career choices.\nWhat happens after I graduate from CWRU in December 2025? It’s hard to say. I intend on continuing to build on my skills in data analysis, specifically around environmental health exposures. I am considering pursuing a Doctorate’s Degree in Public Health, but time and opportunity will tell.\n\n  \n     Download Trailblazer"

I am Christina Yoka, a dedicated environmental health advocate. All of my life I have been a person interested in being in nature and a part of the environment. Whether through swimming in Lake Erie as a child, exploring the metroparks, and later on, getting to see a little bit more of the Earth’s beauty outside of Cleveland, I have always loved finding ways to connect with the natural world.\nToday, I incorporate this passion into my personal life, academic journey, and profession. In my personal life, I connect with the water through scuba diving and in my day-to-day life, through my native plant garden. My academic journey is an interesting one, which includes training in everything from Religious Studies, to Environmental Sciences, to my current pursuit, Public Health. As for my profession, I have always gravitated towards public service where I started in the non-profit world and now work for local government at the Cleveland Department of Public Health.\nI invite you to learn more about this journey by visiting my pages on my Educational Background and my Professional History.\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"

    "text": "After graduating from Cleveland State University in 2010, I was hired by a local environmental non-profit organization, Earth Day Coalition. The mission of Earth Day Coalition was to provide education, inspire leadership, and encourage action for a healthy environment. My first professional experience was a Special Event and Marketing Coordinator. After obtaining my M.A. from Miami University in 2012, I was promoted to the Clean Transportation Program Director. My work at Earth Day Coalition exposed me to a wide range of skill sets that have served as a foundation to my career - project management, communications, program development, grant writing, and more. The first grant that I secured was from the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and this was the “Reducing Gas Emissions through Alternative Fuels” project. The primary aim of this project was to work with industry to adopt lower emitting fuel technologies and to engage with schools on workforce development.\nCLEANinCLE\nI remained at Earth Day Coalition until I entered my current position as Chief of Air Pollution Outreach at the Cleveland Department of Public Health - Division of Air Quality. In this role, I oversee anything that relates to air quality, community engagement, and public health. One key project that I am currently focusing on is a US EPA funded projected called the Community Leveraged Expanded Air Network in Cleveland, or CLEANinCLE. The aim of this project is to expand Cleveland’s air monitoring network into historically redlined communities through the use of low cost sensors. Communities in historically redlined neighborhoods still experience the negative consequences of this historic racist practice. The primary health condition that we are focusing on is pediatric asthma. The national average for pediatric asthma is between 8-10%. There are neighborhoods in Cleveland with pediatric asthma prevalence as high as 25%. We analyzed pediatric asthma and environmental factors to establish targeted neighborhoods in the City of Cleveland with the highest pediatric asthma and environmental exposures. The map below was produced by the Case Western Reserve University Health GIS Health and Hazards Lab with data data provided by Better Health Partnership and publicly available data on the U.S. EPA Environmental Justice Screening Tool.\n\nIn order to determine sensor placement, we solicited community feedback on where the sensors should be placed based off of their perceptions and lived experiences of air quality in their neighborhoods. The data from this project will be made available in near-real time through a air quality data dashboard scheduled to be published in January 2025. Our project partner assisting with the development of this dashboard is the Institute for Smart, Secure and Connecties Cities at Case Western Reserve University. We want to provide easily accessible information to residents so that that they can make informed decisions for protecting their health. Internally, we are using this data to determine poor air quality hotspots and respond with the appropriate regulatory action.\nOur project partners include Better Health Partnership, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland Neighborhood Progress, and the Cleveland Clinic Institute. We have also engaged a paid resident advisory committee to serve as community liaisons and advise on project decisions.\nLego Air Sensor Workshops\nMy work at CDPH also include activities to increase awareness on air pollution and the services we offer. In 2021, we initiated a workshop meant to engage youth in engineering practices and learn basic information on air quality. We now offer a hands-on workshop to schools, youth groups, and the general public where participants can build a working air sensor using Lego’s. We provide all of the necessary supplies and instructions for participants to build the air sensors. The sensor technology is based on light scattering principles. It is a fun way to bring awareness to the importance of air quality and demonstrate careers in air quality/environmental sciences.\nIn 2023, we worked with the Cleveland STEP program to lead their group through a Lego Air Sensor Workshop. Check out the video below to learn more about the workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n     Download current CV"
